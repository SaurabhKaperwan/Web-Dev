API(Application Programming Interface):
---------------------------------------
set of commands, functions, protocols, and objects that we can use
to create S/W or interact with an extrenal system.

Endpoint:
---------
It is a URL or URI(Uniform Resorce Identifier) that an API exposes to allow
communication with other S/W.

It represent a specific function or resource in a web service.

When u make a request to an API, u typically use the API endpoint to
specify the operation u want to perform or the data u want to retrieve.

API Path/ Params:
------------------

To get specific data:


api-endpoint/path

api-endpoint/path?contains=params
api-endpoint/path?contains=params1&type=params2

contains and type are keys and params are value.

API Authentication:
-------------------

To check how often a specific user is using an api.

Every user have a secret and particular key

api-endpoint?appid=key


Postman:
--------
Testing an API with browser is very difficult when
number of params increases.

Therefore we use Postman application.

JSON(JavaScript Object Notation):
---------------------------------
lightweight and text based data interchange format

Easy to read and write, and simple for machines
to parse and generate.

Consists of key-value pairs

JSON.stringfy() => converts a JS object into a JSON string.

JSON.parse() => converts a JSON string into a JS object

In JS:
------
var obj = {
    doors: 2,
    color: "red"
}

JSON:
-----
{"doors":2, "color": "red"}


To make a http get request to extrenal server node:
----------------------------------------------------
u can use :
axios package, request package(Not work now), https native package

We are using https package

Https response status code:
---------------------------
Informational Response(100-199)
Successful Response(200-299)
Redirects(300-399)
Client Errors(400-499)
Server Errors(500-599)
